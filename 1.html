    <h2>MACHINE LEARNING이란?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B8%B0%EA%B3%84%ED%95%99%EC%8A%B5?from=%EB%A8%B8%EC%8B%A0%EB%9F%AC%EB%8B%9D" target="_blank" title="MACHIME LEARNING NAMUWIKI">Machine learning (ML)</a> is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, <strong>relying on <u>patterns and inference</u> instead.</strong> It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.</p>
